# Extracter Function in MeTTa

This project implements a function called `extracter` in MeTTa programming language that filters elements from a list based on a given condition. The function takes a list and a predicate function as inputs, and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the predicate.

## Problem Description

You need to implement a function in MeTTa that extracts only the elements from a list that satisfy a given condition. The function should accept:
- A list
- A predicate function

The function should return a new list that only contains elements which satisfy the predicate function.

### Example:

**Input**:
